<h1>The Best Movies According to Lawrence</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies (today)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>The first Tarantino movie I ever watched. This movie pushed the boundaries of on-screen storytellingand did it while being unapologetically cool</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this is a perfect movie. It has everything in it; love, humor, history and war</p>
<h3>Boyz n the Hood</h3>
<p>A realistic snapshot of 90's gang culture in Los Angeles and how it affects the community as a whole. Also my favorite Hohn Singleton film.</p>
